# COEN424_Shwiper

## Description
Shwiper is developed with the purpose of allowing individuals to browse for secondhand clothing items in their community in a single item presentation format. This format was chosen as it creates more focus on every item presented. Google Firebase is selected as the platform to deploy the backend as a service to this application while using an Android application as the frontend. Within Firebase, Google Cloud Functions will handle requests from the Android application through a REST API. Firestore is selected as the NoSQL database.  

## Features
- Allows users to login or signup
- Allows users to view ads from Kijiji in a single item presentation format
- Allows users to click on the card and show more information about the product
- Allows users to like, by swiping to the right, and store an ad in the database to view in the future

## Future Updates
- Allow users to delete ads after viewing them or when they are removed from Kijiji
- Allow users to have ad suggestions that are tailored to their preference
- Allow users to browse more second hand retailing services like eBay
